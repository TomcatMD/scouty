# Scouty

**Scouty** is your personal assistant for reviewing job postings and evaluating their relevance to your professional profile. It crawls popular job boards, analyzes postings with a **local LLM**, and scores them based on your skills, experience, and preferences.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Multi-source crawling** ‚Äì Supports [Just Join IT](https://justjoin.it), [No Fluff Jobs](https://nofluffjobs.com), and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com).
- ü§ñ **Local LLM analysis** ‚Äì Uses `gpt-oss:20b` via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (no API keys required).
- üìä **Relevance scoring** ‚Äì Rates jobs from `0.0` to `5.0` with a brief explanation.
- üíæ **Persistent storage** ‚Äì Saves all results in a lightweight `SQLite` database (`data/jobs.db`).
- üì≤ **Telegram notifications** ‚Äì Instant alerts about new hot matches via Telegram.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ruby **3.4.7+** (install via [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com); a `.tool-versions` file is included)

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

### 3. Install Ollama and pull `gpt-oss:20b`

Example installation using Homebrew on macOS:

```sh
brew install ollama
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384 ollama serve
```

**Note.** Ollama can also be installed using alternative methods, such as Docker. By default, Ollama is expected to run on a local server, but you can modify the server location in `config.yml` (see below).

### 4. Prepare Your Profile

To tailor job recommendations, copy the example configuration file `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and update the parameters to reflect your skills, experience, and preferences. Refer to the comments in `config.yml` for guidance on each parameter.

```sh
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

### 5. Run Scouty

```sh
bin/scouty
```

### 6. Review Results

By default, Scouty generates an HTML report at `data/report.html` for easy viewing of your job matches and analysis results. Simply open this file in your web browser.

```sh
open data/report.html
```

For more detailed inspection, you can also review the raw data in the SQLite database using tools such as:

- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org)
- The built-in SQLite CLI:

```sh
sqlite3 data/jobs.db
```

## üí° Tips

- Ensure LM Studio is running while using Scouty to process job postings.
- The analysis process may take some time, depending on the number of job postings and system resources.
- Run `bin/scouty --help` to view available parameters for running.
- Check `data/jobs.db` regularly to review new job matches and clear old data if needed.
- Experiments indicate that a context size of 16384 for Ollama is sufficient to handle the processing workload.
